                        <p>Preikestolen or Prekestolen, also known by the English translations of Preacher's Pulpit or Pulpit Rock, is a famous tourist attraction in Forsand, Ryfylke, Norway. It consists of a steep cliff which rises 604 metres (1982 feet) above Lysefjorden, opposite the Kjerag plateau, with an almost flat top of approximately 25 by 25 metres (82 by 82 feet).</p>
						<p>The hike to the plateau will take about two hours. Your starting point will be the area around the mountain lodge Preikestolen Fjellstue, which offers accommodation and meals to the weary traveller. This area also has public toilets, ample parking, a kiosk, and other facilities available. In recent years a team of skilled stonemasons and sherpas from Nepal have done an impressive job of improving the path to Preikestolen. Steps have been built in the roughest areas, and a rocky trail has been made to keep the impact on the environment localized and to a minimum. As a result, the hike can be undertaken by most people with no significant disabilities.  </p>

                        <p>The Plitvice lakes National Park belongs to Dinaric karst area and due to its specific geology, geomorphology and hydrology it truly is one of the most impressive karst entities in the world.</p>
						<p>Apart from dolomitic rock, mesosoic limestones with dolomite inserts prevail. The ratio between less porous or water-retaining dolomites and porous Jurassic limestone sediments in the karst has influenced the landscape of the overall area today. Specific hydrology properties of rock have enabled water retention on Triassic dolomite rocks, as well as canyon formation by water cutting through Cretaceous limestone deposits. Tufa barriers are a phenomenon enabling water to remain inside the lakes.</p>

                        <p>Salar de Uyuni (or Salar de Tunupa) is the world's largest salt flat at 10,582 square kilometers (4,086 sq mi). It is located in the Daniel Campos Province in Potos√≠ in southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes and is at an elevation of 3,656 meters (11,995 ft) above mean sea level.</p>
                        <p>The Salar was formed as a result of transformations between several prehistoric lakes. It is covered by a few meters of salt crust, which has an extraordinary flatness with the average altitude variations within one meter over the entire area of the Salar. The crust serves as a source of salt and covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in lithium. It contains 50 to 70% of the world's lithium reserves, which is in the process of being extracted. The large area, clear skies, and the exceptional flatness of the surface make the Salar an ideal object for calibrating the altimeters of Earth observation satellites. </p>

                        <p>Cathedral Cove is arguably one of the most picturesque spots (and there are many) in The Coromandel Peninsula.</p>
                        <p>From beautiful Hahei Beach on the Coromandel Peninsula you can walk to Cathedral Cove, where a naturally formed archway deserves photographic attention. From the north end of the beach, a one hour walking track leads along the cliff top and then descends to the Cove. Here a gigantic arched cavern passes through a white rock headland to join two secluded coves. The cathedral-like arch gives the whole area an air of grandeur. The beach is sandy with shady pohutukawa trees along the foreshore - a perfect place for a picnic and a swim. Just off the beach at Cathedral Cove is a large pinnacle of pumice breccia rock known as 'Te Hoho'. Over centuries this has been sculpted by wind and water - it now looks like the prow of a large ship steaming into the beach. If you prefer a slightly shorter walk (about 1.5 hours return), start from the car park at the end of Grange Road in Hahei - turn left just after the Hahei shops. </p>
